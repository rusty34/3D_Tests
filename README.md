3D Testing

This code is used to test out how to use OpenGL.
The Unofficial OpenGL SDK needs to be placed in the same folder as the premake file to make it work - http://glsdk.sourceforge.net

I am following the tutorials at - http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html

As I work through the tutorials, I will use what I learn to try and make a basic 3D world with some movable objects.
